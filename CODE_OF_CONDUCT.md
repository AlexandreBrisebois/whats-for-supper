# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible.

- Preferred: Open a confidential issue at: https://github.com/AlexandreBrisebois/whats-for-supper/issues/new/choose and select the appropriate template or choose "Report abuse" if available.
- If the issue interface does not suit your needs, add a private note to a project maintainer via their GitHub profile: https://github.com/AlexandreBrisebois

All reports will be handled with discretion. Retaliation against anyone who reports an incident in good faith is strictly prohibited.

## Enforcement Process

1. Reports will be acknowledged within 72 hours.
2. Maintainers will review the report, gather relevant information, and may reach out to involved parties for clarification.
3. Depending on severity and context, responsive actions may include:
   - Warning with guidance
   - Temporary or permanent removal from project spaces
   - Reporting to platform hosts if necessary

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
